# Env samples for each docker container that requires some env variables to be specified

1. Just copy/paste the content of `-sample` file, remove the `-sample` suffix and specify a correct value for each env variable.
2. NOTE: Reduncancy, but it makes configuring env vars simple and we are sure that only required env vars are passed to the container.
